# Module3_Python_Challenge
the .ipynb have the code
for the Bank Challenge, the code is a bit messy but it runs
it could be more efficient but there's more than one way to do something
for the Poll Challenge, I took the time to think it out before I worked on it
it was also simpler so I was able to do it faster
