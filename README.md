# Module3_Python_Challenge

the .ipynb have the code

for the Bank Challenge, the code is a bit messy but it runs
it could be more efficient but there's more than one way to do something
i was having trouble with it, but it works! 

Note to grader: i'm sorry but sometimes for me the long way is easier
like in math I have to write out 2*2*2 = 8 rather than 2^3 = 8
sorry if the code is complicated but my brain prefers a longer but easier route than something shorter but harder

for the Poll Challenge, I took the time to think it out before I worked on it
it was also simpler so I was able to do it faster
